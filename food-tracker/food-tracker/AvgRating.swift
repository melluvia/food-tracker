// This will keep track of all ratings for each meal(class will be instantiated for each meal when a new meal is created) and will keep track of all ratings/changes as an array of ratings (so calculating average will be as simple as taking a new rating, adding it to the array, then iterating through the array to get the sum and then divide by count [avg])
