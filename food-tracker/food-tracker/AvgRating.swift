// This will keep track of all ratings for each meal(class will be instantiated for each meal when a new meal is created) and will keep track of all ratings/changes as an array of ratings (so calculating average will be as simple as taking a new rating, adding it to the array, then iterating through the array to get the sum and then divide by count [avg])

import Foundation

class AvgRating {
    
    var avgRating: [Double] = []
    var currentRating: Double = 0
    
    //make a function that pulls in all meals (from backendless)
    
    //make another function that calculates average rating (using star system..round up or down to the nearest half-star)
    
    //make another function that creates an array to store all ratings for each meal (this way we can continue to update average by tracking all previous ratings from all users)  ... this function will also need a database (backendless) side
    
    
    //***create a class for changing the textfield to show average stars
